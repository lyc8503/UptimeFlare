# ✔[UptimeFlare](https://github.com/lyc8503/UptimeFlare)

A more advanced, serverless, and free uptime monitoring & status page solution, powered by Cloudflare Workers, complete with a user-friendly interface.

🎉 **[UPDATE 2026/01/03]** I have just migrated UptimeFlare from KV to D1 Database. I also updated the Terraform Cloudflare provider to v5 and improved the deployment process. The data structure has been optimized to resolve long-standing performance issues.

New users can deploy directly, while existing users can have a simple auto migration process (upgrade docs below)! Feel free to open an issue if you run into any trouble deploying.
